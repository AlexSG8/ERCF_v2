| Qty per Site | Part | Example Source Reference | Comments |
|-------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
|   1   | 8mm dia. x 50mm Stainless Steel Rod, Tube, or Dowell Pin | https://www.amazon.com/uxcell-Stainless-Cylindrical-Support-Elements/dp/B07Z6HPXPW, Amazon Alternate https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081GBTQGC (sheared ends may need to be cleaned up), Aliexpress https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256807032014162.html | Undersized shaft (7.93-7.97mm or 5/16" dia) works the best.  Custom rewinder widths are also possible using the Fusion 360 parametric model and you can cut shaft to whatever length is desired.  8mm (or 5/16") diameter straight stainless tube is also an excellent alternative to solid rods as the are much easier to cut to length like https://www.amazon.com/uxcell-Stainless-Thickness-Seamless-Straight/dp/B081GBTQGC or https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805495613016.html. |

   OR:
|   4   | 688 bearings | As an alternative to the 608 bearings for Drive and Idler axles, so would be a total of 5 688 bearings including the Tensioner Arm bearing.  This allows for only needing to buy one bearing size but the 688's might be a tighter fit on the axle shafts.|

## Assembly Tips: ##

1.  After inserting the 40mm Tensioner Screw through the Tensioner Arm and sliding the spring onto the screw, the heat set insert should be secured using CA adhesive (Superglue) with ~10mm of the screw protruding beyond the insert to prevent it from turning on the screw.
